        <h2>Introduction to <span>Typography</span></h2>
        <p>Aside from the color palette, the typography of a website is one of the most important and impactful influencers of user experience. The right typefaces elevate a design and make the content pleasant to read. The wrong typography can ruin the visitor’s experience and cause them to look for alternative websites.</p>
        <p>There are a number of things to consider when choosing typefaces for a website design. Let’s dive in!</p>

        <h2>Planning Your Web Typography</h2>
        <p>Before you start diving into which fonts you want to use for a website, it’s important to plan out your typography. You need to have a solid understanding of how the typefaces you choose will be used.</p>
        <p>How many heading levels will there be? What about meta text for things like bylines on articles or photo captions? Will there be different body text sizes for different sections of the site? Are there any instances of big typography, such as over hero images?</p>
        <p>Make a list of what you need so that when you start exploring typefaces, you can see how they’ll appear at different sizes and in different styles based on your actual project needs.</p>

        <h2>1. <span>Tone and Mood</span></h2>
        <p>One of the most important determinations when planning typography is to decide the tone and mood of the site. Is it formal or casual? Playful or serious? Modern or traditional?</p>
        <p>Once you know the tone, you can eliminate a lot of typeface options. You wouldn’t use Baskerville for a playful, modern site, just like you wouldn’t use Futura for a site that’s formal and traditional.</p>

        <h2>2. <span>Readability</span></h2>
        <p>People often confuse legibility with readability. Legibility is how easily recognizable each letterform is within a typeface. Readability, on the other hand, is how easy the typeface is to read in larger blocks of text.</p>
        <p>The legibility of a typeface definitely affects its readability. But so do factors like the size of the typeface, contrast with the background, the weight of the font, and other visual factors.</p>
        <p>Understanding how your typographic content will be used in your design is important before choosing a typeface.</p>

        <h2>3. <span>Scale</span></h2>
        <p>Not all typefaces look good at all sizes. Some typefaces that are readable for body copy might look boring when used for headings or titles, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>Knowing the scale at which you’ll use typefaces in your design allows for more informed design decisions. This is why planning your typography at the outset of a project is so important.</p>

        <h2>4. <span>Combining Typefaces</span></h2>
        <p>There’s nothing that says you have to use more than one typeface in your design. There are excellent examples of websites that only use one typeface, such as the Stripe site or Akaya B. Ito’s site.</p>
        <p>However, using more than one typeface can add both visual interest and reinforce your site’s visual hierarchy. Here are a few tips:</p>
        <p>Start by figuring out the main typeface you want to use, either for your body copy or headlines. Next, consider the contrast between typefaces. Contrast is key to effective combination, but too much contrast can make one typeface overpower the other. It’s also essential to pay attention to the x-height and basic shapes of typefaces to ensure they combine well.</p>

  <h2>5. <span>Licensing</span></h2>
        <p>Licensing is one of the most overlooked parts of choosing web typography. If you’re using a service like Google Fonts or Typekit, this isn’t much of a concern since the fonts are generally licensed for web use.</p>
        <p>However, if you source fonts from elsewhere, make sure they’re licensed for commercial use. If your project is part of a larger brand, confirm that the licensing allows for use in other materials.</p>

        <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
        <p>Choosing the right typography for your website projects takes experimentation and trying different options until you find the one that fits. Typography can have a profound impact on the way visitors perceive a website. The right typography creates an enjoyable experience, while type that is hard to read or doesn’t match the tone of the site can negatively impact UX. Spend the time and resources to find the right fit!
